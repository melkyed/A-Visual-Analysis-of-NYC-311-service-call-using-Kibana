# A Visual Analysis of NYC 311 service call using Kibana
 Elasticsearch:- A Visual Analysis of NYC 311 service call for the time between Jan 01, 2010 and Aug 27, 2020 using Kibana.

 NYC OpenData has published data regarding 311 service request every day since 2010. Each day NYC311 receives thousands of requests related to several hundred type of non-emergency services, including noise complaints, plumbing issues, and illegally parked cars. These requests are received by NYC311 and forwarded to the relevant agencies such as police, buildings or transportation. The agency respond to the request, addresses it and closes it.
For this project I considered data taken from (https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) on August 27, 2020. Which contains 23,743,211 observations with 41 columns.  I explored and analyzed NYC311 Service requests historical data sets with the aim to understand diverse patterns, and to gain valuable insights.
